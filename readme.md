mintyrails.sh
=============

Easy RVM ruby+rails bash install script for Mint.

This script will take you from zero to development on a fresh, updated Linux Mint 13/14 system. It's inspired by Josh Frye's Rails Ready (https://github.com/joshfng/railsready/) but simplified for Mint and tailored to a development environment.

####What's installed

* Ruby+Rails and all prerequisites
* MySQL
* Git
* Vim
* node.js runtime (optional)
* Imagemagick (optional)

####Install
Upgrade your system via the update manager or `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` then run
  * `wget --no-check-certificate "https://raw.github.com/XanderStrike/mintyrails/master/mintyrails.sh" && bash mintyrails.sh`

####Notes
While primarily designed for Mint, this script has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10
